# TODO for Maven Installation and Testing

- [x] Extract the downloaded apache-maven.zip to a directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven)
- [x] Add the Maven bin directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\bin) to the system PATH environment variable
- [x] Open a new terminal and verify Maven installation by running `mvn -version`
- [x] Test Maven by running `mvn clean install` on the existing Java project
- [x] Verify that the build completes successfully without errors
- [x] Check for any warnings or issues during the build process
- [x] Confirm that the project tests run successfully if applicable
- [x] Report any errors or issues encountered during testing

This will ensure thorough testing of the Maven installation and its integration with the project.
